**Credit Card Transaction Detection Model**


**Introduction**

This repository contains a machine learning model developed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The model utilizes various preprocessing techniques, handles class imbalance, and employs classification algorithms to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine.


**Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of credit card transactions, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or genuine. It contains features such as transaction amount, time, and other anonymized variables.

**Preprocessing**

Data Cleaning: Remove any duplicate entries or unnecessary columns.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data and create new ones if necessary.
Normalization: Scale numerical features to ensure uniformity and prevent any particular feature from dominating the model.
Handling Missing Values: Address any missing values in the dataset appropriately.
Class Imbalance
Class imbalance is a common issue in fraud detection datasets where the number of genuine transactions far exceeds the number of fraudulent ones. To handle this:

Undersampling: Reduce the number of genuine transactions to balance the dataset.
Oversampling: Increase the number of fraudulent transactions through techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

**Model Training**

Algorithm Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the chosen algorithm(s) to optimize performance.
Cross-Validation: Validate the model's performance using techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.
